    <p>In the early 2000s, Bajaj Auto bought a controlling stake in the Tempo Firodia company,
        renaming it "Bajaj Tempo". Germany's Daimler-Benz owned 16% of Bajaj Tempo,
         but Daimler sold their stake back to the Firodia group.
          It was agreed that Bajaj Tempo would gradually phase out the use of the "Tempo" brand name, as it still belonged to Mercedes-Benz.
          The name of the company was changed to Force Motors in 2005, dropping "Bajaj" as well as "Tempo",
           over the objections of Bajaj Auto with whom the company shares a long history as well as a compound wall.</p>
